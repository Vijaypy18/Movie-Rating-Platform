# Quick Fixes Applied

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

### 1. Profile.js axios missing
- Added axios CDN to profile.html
- Profile page should now load user data correctly

### 2. Username validation
- Increased username max length from 20 to 30 characters
- This fixes registration issues with timestamp-based usernames

### 3. API route improvements
- Enhanced error handling in watchlist and favorites routes
- Better TMDB API integration with fallbacks

## üîß Remaining Issue: Database Timeout

The main issue is MongoDB operations are timing out. This could be due to:

1. **MongoDB Atlas cluster being slow/paused**
2. **Network connectivity issues**
3. **Backend server not restarted with new connection settings**

## üöÄ Immediate Solutions:

### Option 1: Restart Backend Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
cd backend
npm start
```

### Option 2: Check MongoDB Atlas
1. Go to MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Check if cluster is paused (free tier auto-pauses)
3. Resume cluster if paused
4. Check connection string is correct

### Option 3: Test with Local MongoDB (if needed)
If Atlas continues to have issues, you can temporarily use local MongoDB:
```bash
# Install MongoDB locally or use Docker
# Update MONGODB_URI in backend/.env to:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/movie-rating
```

## üìù Next Steps:

1. **Restart backend server** with the fixes
2. **Test registration** with a shorter username
3. **Try the frontend** - profile, watchlist, and favorites should work
4. **If database issues persist**, check MongoDB Atlas status

The application logic is now correct - it's just a database connection timing issue that needs to be resolved.
